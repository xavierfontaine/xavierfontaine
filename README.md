### Hi!

In my spare time, I have been developping a handful of apps & APIs for personal use.

Here are 3 pins 📍
* [`booktocards`](https://github.com/xavierfontaine/booktocards) 📖: my web app for creating flashcards from Japanese books, websites, etc.

* [`generatools`](https://github.com/xavierfontaine/generatools) ⚗️: my old (2021) experimentation API for Natural Language Generation (programmatic prompting, grid exploration of prompt configurations, output evaluation interface, and experiment storage.)

* [`mysensei`](https://github.com/xavierfontaine/mysensei) 👩‍🏫: a tiny web app that generates mnemonic stories for memorizing Japanese kanjis and vocabularies. More an exploration of [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/) than anything else.
