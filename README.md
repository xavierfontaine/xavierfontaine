### Hi!

In my spare time, I develop a handful of apps & APIs for my personal use.

* [`omakase`](https://github.com/xavierfontaine/omakase) 🍣: an app for creating flashcards from Japanese content.

* [`booktocards`](https://github.com/xavierfontaine/booktocards) 📖: the predecessor of `omakase`.

* [`generatools`](https://github.com/xavierfontaine/generatools) ⚗️: my old (2021) API for Natural Language Generation (programmatic prompting, grid exploration of prompt configurations, output evaluation interface, and experiment storage).
