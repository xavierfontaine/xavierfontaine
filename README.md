### Hi!

This space collects apps & APIs I have developed for personal use.

The pins 📍
* [`booktocards`](https://github.com/xavierfontaine/booktocards) 📖: the web app I use to create flashcards from Japanese books, websites, etc. 

* [`generatools`](https://github.com/xavierfontaine/generatools) ⚗️: my old (2021) experimentation API for Natural Language Generation.
Programmatic prompting, grid exploration of prompt configurations, output evaluation UMI, and
experiment storage.

* [`mysensei`](https://github.com/xavierfontaine/mysensei) 👩‍🏫: a tiny web app that generates mnemonics for Japanese kanjis and vocabularies. More an exploration of [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/) than anything else.
